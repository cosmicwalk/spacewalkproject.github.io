                                <p><a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/">Red Hat Network</a> (RHN Classic) first started in
                                    2001 as a hosted
                                    service. RHN later spawned a stand-alone product called <a

                                    Spacewalk as a project officially became an open source, community driven project in
                                    June 2008, and

                                <p>Red Hat's continued commitment to open source technology and the open source

                                    the release of Spacewalk in 2008. By releasing the Satellite code base, Red Hat
                                    enhanced its ability
                                    to incorporate new open source management
                                    projects into the future roadmap for its products and solutions.</p>

                                <p>The Spacewalk project and the Red Hat Satellite product fully support and believe
                                    that community
                                    participation is a critical success factor for any open source initiative.</p>

                                    Red Hat Satellite 6 is a re-engineering of the Red Hat Satellite product.
                                    Spacewalk (and its downstream product, Red Hat Satellite 5) is a systems-management
                                    tool, and Satellite 6 is designed to accomplish the same set of goals.
                                    However, Satellite 6 has been built from the ground-up on different and more modern technologies.
                                    Spacewalk is <em>not</em> the upstream for Satellite 6, and never will be.Instead Satellite 6 is a federation
                                    of several upstream open source projects, including
                                    <a href="http://www.katello.org/">Katello</a>,
                                    <a href="http://theforeman.org/">Foreman</a>,
                                    <a href="http://www.pulpproject.org/">Pulp</a>, and

                            <dt>&nbsp;What does this mean for Spacewalk?</dt>
                            <dd>
                              <p>
                              The <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite">Red Hat Satellite and Proxy Server Lifecycle</a>
                              shows that Satellite 5 will continue to be supported by Red Hat until May 31, 2020.
                              Spacewalk remains the upstream for Satellite 5, and Red Hat will continue its "upstream first" philosophy on updates
                              for the benefit of the Spacewalk community.
                              Red Hat will continue to manage and maintain the Spacewalk project, infrastructure, and builders.
                              Releases will be created as deemed appropriate.
                              However, Red Hat's code contributions will decrease over time, as the focus shifts to maintenance and stabilization
                              of the current set of features.
